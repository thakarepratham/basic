    <p>THE EXTRAVEHICULAR ACTIVITY <a href="https://www.spacex.com/humanspaceflight/">(EVA)SUIT</a> </p>
    <p> <i> In February 2022 </i> , Jared Isaacman and SpaceX announced the Polaris Program, an effort designed to rapidly advance human spaceflight capabilities, while also supporting important causes here on Earth.Vast also secured an option for an additional human spaceflight mission to the station aboard a Dragon spacecraft.</p><br>
    <p> <strong>Polaris Dawn</strong>, the first of the program’s three human spaceflight missions, is targeted to launch to orbit no earlier than summer 2024. During the five-day mission, the crew will perform SpaceX’s first-ever Extravehicular Activity (more commonly known as an EVA or spacewalk) from Dragon, which will also be the first-ever commercial astronaut spacewalk. This historic milestone will also be the first time four astronauts will be exposed to the vacuum of space at the same time.</p>
